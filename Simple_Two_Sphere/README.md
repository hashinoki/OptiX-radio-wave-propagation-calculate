# wave_compute.cpp
File describing the setup and startup of ray tracing with OptiX.

# wave_compute.cu
This file is the calculation kernel for ray tracing.  
This is where the radio propagation loss calculations are implemented.  
Collision detection is implemented in OptiX for a single primitive (sphere).
# wave_compute.h
Header files for wave_compute.cpp and wave_compute.cu.
